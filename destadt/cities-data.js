        history: "Berlin has a rich and complex history spanning over 800 years. Founded in the 13th century, it became the capital of Prussia and later the German Empire. The city played a central role in World War II and was subsequently divided by the Berlin Wall from 1961 to 1989, symbolizing the Cold War's division of East and West. After reunification in 1990, Berlin emerged as a dynamic, multicultural metropolis and has become one of Europe's most important political, cultural, and technological centers.",
        
        climate: "Berlin has a temperate seasonal climate with warm summers and cold winters. Summer temperatures average 20-25°C (68-77°F), while winter temperatures can drop to -2 to 3°C (28-37°F). The best time to visit is from May to September when the weather is pleasant and outdoor activities are abundant. Spring brings beautiful blooming parks, while autumn offers colorful foliage and cultural events.",

The city is also very bike-friendly with dedicated cycling lanes. A day pass for public transport costs around €8-9, making it affordable to explore the entire city.",
